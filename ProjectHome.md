A Taxi service with android platforms both for users and taxis and a centralized server to optimize overall service times. Although there is a central server the taxi decisions were done locally and simulated using a BDI (belief, desire, intention) model to maximize each taxi objectives. The centralized server was used mainly to suggest the best actions in order to achieve best overall service/cost performance and to gather system info. This project was done using jadex (BDI model) and the google maps API to calculate routes.
